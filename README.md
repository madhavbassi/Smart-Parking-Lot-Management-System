🚗 This is a Smart Parking Lot Management System
A Python + Streamlit project to manage parking spots, visualize real-time status, and calculate parking fees — all in an interactive UI.
👋 About This Project
I Recently learned the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, and  I wanted to build something practical, using those concepts of (OOPS) not just another console-based app. That’s when I thought of parking lots — they’re everywhere, it's chaotic without structure, and a great fit for classes, objects, and real-time UI.

So, I built a Smart Parking Lot System using:

💻 Python OOP (Inheritance, Classes, Encapsulation)

📊 I used Streamlit for an interactive and modern UI

🧮 Real-time calculations of duration & fee

₹ Rupee-based billing (because I’m based in India )

What started as a learning project actually turned out to be a super fun and satisfying full-stack mini project

🧠 Features
✅ You can add parking spots dynamically (Car, Bike, Truck)

🚘 Park and remove vehicles with live updates

⏱️ It Calculates how long a vehicle has been parked

💰 Also Calculates fees in ₹ based on vehicle type

📊 Shows available spots in real time

📈 Finally displays total income earned from parking!
